Your strengths: refactoring, complex-logic, architecture, debugging, documentation



## Memory (from past work)

## Project Memory

This is learned knowledge about this codebase from previous work.
Use this context to guide your approach.

### Project Context
- Combat AI uses state machine: PATROLLING, ALERT, ENGAGING, SUPPRESSING, ADVANCING, SEEKING_COVER, DEAD. Add new states to CombatantState enum in types.ts
- Player feedback systems: CameraShakeSystem for visual impact, PlayerSuppressionSystem for near-miss effects. Both integrate via SandboxSystemManager.connectSystems()
- Weapon inventory uses hotbar keys 1-5: 1=Shotgun, 2=Grenades, 3=Rifle (primary), 4=Sandbags, 5=SMG. Switch via WeaponSlot enum
- DOM overlay systems (vignette, suppression) use fixed positioning with pointer-events: none and z-index layering. See PlayerSuppressionSystem.ts for pattern
- Near-miss detection uses distance threshold (2.5m) and triggers in CombatantCombat.ts during enemy fire logic at line 290

### Conventions (How Things Are Done Here)
- All tasks commit directly to master - no feature branches used. Verify build passes before committing with npm run build
- Three.js game - textures typed as unknown in recent versions. Cast texture.image when accessing for dimension calculations
- HUD elements connect via setter methods like setGrenadeSystem(). New HUD features need explicit wiring in PixelArtSandbox.ts
- New weapon types require: WeaponSpec definition, GunplayCore instance, 3D model in ProgrammaticGunFactory, WeaponSlot enum value, key binding in onKeyDown, and InventoryManager slot
- Score/feedback popups use CSS animations with object pooling - see ScorePopupSystem.ts and DamageNumberSystem.ts for patterns
- CSS animations should be injected once with unique style IDs and checked for existence before creating. Dispose methods must clean up injected styles
- DOM overlay effects use fixed positioning with pointer-events: none - avoids blocking game input
- Object pooling for transient UI elements (popups, damage numbers) prevents GC spikes in render loop
- CSS animations should inject styles once with unique IDs and clean up on dispose()
- Weapon systems require 6 integration points: WeaponSpec, GunplayCore, 3D model, WeaponSlot, key binding, InventoryManager
- Suppression systems integrate via setter pattern: setPlayerSuppressionSystem() called in connectSystems()
- Suppression systems integrate via setter pattern: setPlayerSuppressionSystem() called in connectSystems()
- Near-miss detection uses distance threshold (2.5m) and registers hits in CombatantCombat.ts during enemy fire logic

### Warnings (What to Avoid)
- [!!] Uncommitted MatchEndScreen work exists in src/ui/end/ and PlayerStatsTracker.ts - complete integration before shipping match flow improvements
- [!] Uncommitted MatchEndScreen warning is now resolved - all match flow improvements are integrated
- [!] Shotgun weapon system already exists in codebase since initial commit - verify feature existence before creating tasks
- [!!] Build produces 1.16MB bundle (warning threshold 500KB) - acceptable for Three.js game but monitor growth
- [!!] Build size at 1.16MB - acceptable for Three.js game but monitor for growth





## Human Communication

You have access to the `mycel` CLI for communicating with the human operator via Telegram.


**Your current work:** Integrate compass into main HUD with objective markers
**You are:** claude

**Message format:** Always prefix messages with your identity: `[TASK] claude/haiku #6076c2cd`

### Check User Inbox (HIGH SIGNAL)
```bash
# See recent messages from human - check this for context/feedback
/home/mkagent/repos/mycelium/.venv/bin/mycel inbox --limit 5

# JSON output for parsing (includes msg_id for replies)
/home/mkagent/repos/mycelium/.venv/bin/mycel inbox --json --limit 5
```
Unprompted messages (not replies) are especially important - the human reached out proactively.

### Reply to Specific Messages (Threading)
```bash
# Reply directly to a user message (creates thread in Telegram)
/home/mkagent/repos/mycelium/.venv/bin/mycel reply <msg_id> "Your response to their specific message"
```
Use this to acknowledge specific feedback or answer specific questions.

### Alignment (when you need human input)

**Async (recommended)** - Send question, continue working:
```bash
/home/mkagent/repos/mycelium/.venv/bin/mycel align "[TASK] claude/haiku #6076c2cd: Your question here" --options "Option1" "Option2" "Option3"
# Human replies when they can. Check: /home/mkagent/repos/mycelium/.venv/bin/mycel signals
```

**Sync (blocking)** - Wait for reply before continuing:
```bash
/home/mkagent/repos/mycelium/.venv/bin/mycel align "[TASK] claude/haiku #6076c2cd: Need answer before I continue" --options "A" "B" --wait --timeout 3600
```
Use longer timeouts (3600-28800) for questions asked late at night.

### Notifications
```bash
# Plain text (auto HTML-escaped)
/home/mkagent/repos/mycelium/.venv/bin/mycel notify "[TASK] claude/haiku #6076c2cd: Status update"

# Code/YAML block (formatted nicely for Telegram)
/home/mkagent/repos/mycelium/.venv/bin/mycel notify --code --lang yaml "summary:
  tasks_created: 3
  status: complete"

# Raw HTML when needed
/home/mkagent/repos/mycelium/.venv/bin/mycel notify --raw "<b>bold</b> text"
```

### When to check inbox
- Start of task (any recent user feedback?)
- Before major decisions (did user send guidance?)
- When stuck (user may have sent hints)

### When to ask for alignment
- Ambiguous requirements
- Multiple valid approaches
- Destructive operations
- Decisions outside your knowledge

## Output Requirements (CRITICAL)

**You must ALWAYS land on an output. Never just stop or skip.**

### If Task Completes Successfully
1. Commit your changes with descriptive message
2. Provide summary of what was done
3. Notify: `/home/mkagent/repos/mycelium/.venv/bin/mycel notify "[TASK] claude/haiku #6076c2cd: Completed - [summary]"`

### If You're Blocked or Need Human Input

If you cannot complete due to missing info, dependencies, or scope:

1. **Commit any progress** made so far
2. **Create a follow-up task** with full context:
```bash
/home/mkagent/repos/mycelium/.venv/bin/mycel task create "Continue: [what needs doing]" \
  --repo {repo_path} --agent claude --model sonnet \
  --prompt "## Context
Previous work: [what was accomplished]
Blocker: [why you stopped]
Human was asked: [question if any]
Next steps: [what the follow-up agent should do]

When human responds or blocker is resolved, complete this work."
```
3. **Notify** what happened:
```bash
/home/mkagent/repos/mycelium/.venv/bin/mycel notify "[TASK] claude/haiku #6076c2cd: Blocked - created follow-up task. Reason: [brief reason]"
```

### If Alignment Times Out

When `--wait` times out without response:
- **Low risk decision**: Proceed with your best judgment, document reasoning
- **High risk decision**: Create follow-up task describing the decision needed
- **Never just skip** - always produce output or handoff

### Output Validation

Your session should end with one of:
- Commits + summary (work completed)
- Follow-up task created (work handed off)
- Clear failure reason + next steps (work blocked)




## Task

You are integrating the compass system into the HUD for Terror in the Jungle, a 3D pixel art FPS game.

## Context
A CompassSystem exists (src/ui/compass/CompassSystem.ts) but is not integrated into the main HUD. Players need directional awareness and objective markers for zone control gameplay.

## Discovery
Read these files:
1. src/ui/compass/CompassSystem.ts - Existing compass implementation
2. src/ui/hud/HUDSystem.ts - Main HUD orchestrator
3. src/ui/hud/HUDElements.ts - HUD element patterns
4. src/systems/world/ZoneManager.ts - Zone positions for markers
5. src/core/SandboxSystemManager.ts - System initialization

## Implementation
1. Initialize CompassSystem in SandboxSystemManager if not already done
2. Add compass bar to top-center of HUD:
   - 300-400px wide strip
   - Shows N/E/S/W cardinal directions
   - Scrolls based on player camera yaw
3. Add zone objective markers on compass:
   - Icons for each zone (A, B, C, etc.)
   - Color-coded: blue=friendly, red=enemy, white=neutral
   - Blinking when contested
4. Connect to player camera for real-time updates

## Technical Notes
- Use DOM/CSS (match existing HUD patterns)
- Keep performance light - update once per frame
- Zone markers should show relative direction and distance

## Validation
- Build: npm run build (must succeed)
- Test: npm run dev
  - Compass appears at top-center
  - Cardinal directions scroll as player turns
  - Zone markers visible with correct colors
  - Contested zones blink

## Completion
When complete: test compass in browser, commit with descriptive message, provide summary.


## Required Output Format
At the END of your response, include this structured output block for machine parsing:

<task_result>
  <commit>7-40 character git commit hash</commit>
  <summary>One sentence description of what was accomplished</summary>
</task_result>

Example:
<task_result>
  <commit>abc1234</commit>
  <summary>Added docstring to StreamEvent class with usage context</summary>
</task_result>
```
