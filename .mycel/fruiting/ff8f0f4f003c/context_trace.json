Run: git status - verify branch state\n2. Run: git log --oneline -25 - see the commits that need pushing\n3. Check if there are any uncommitted changes that should be handled first\n\n## Implementation\n\n### 1. Verify State\n- Check for uncommitted changes\n- Check if remote is reachable\n- Ensure we're on master branch\n\n### 2. Push\n- Push to origin/master\n- Handle any conflicts if they arise (unlikely since this is a single-developer repo)\n\n### 3. Handle Untracked Directories\nThere are untracked .mycel/ directories - these can be ignored (add to .gitignore if needed)\n\n## Validation\nAfter push:\n1. Run git status to confirm 'Your branch is up to date with origin/master'\n2. Verify no errors during push\n\n## Completion\nReport the push result and any issues encountered.",
