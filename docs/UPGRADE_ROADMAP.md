# Terror in the Jungle — Alpha Upgrade Roadmap

This living document groups the meta‑level tasks required to evolve the prototype into an alpha-ready build. Each block contains:

- **Outcome** — what success looks like.
- **Why Now** — risk or opportunity addressed.
- **Readiness Checklist** — preconditions or artifacts we expect before greenlighting individual tasks.
- **Key Tasks** — modular TODOs with short metaprompts that future tickets can reuse verbatim.
- **Best-Practice References (2024–2025)** — starting points for implementation patterns, code samples, or discussions.

> **Usage**: Treat every Key Task’s metaprompt as a seed for a more detailed implementation ticket. Update this roadmap as work lands or new discoveries surface (profiling data, player feedback, etc.).

## 1. Rendering & Post-Processing Modernization

**Outcome**: Stable 120 FPS headroom on RTX 3070 at native resolution with post effects toggled, WebGPU-compatible pipeline ready for rollout.

**Why Now**: Current composer forces HalfFloat offscreen buffers and SMAA even when not needed, consuming ~4–6 ms CPU/GPU in dense scenes.

**Readiness Checklist**
- Capture GPU frame profiles (Chrome WebGPU profiler or WebGL Insight) for Zone Control & Open Frontier.
- Inventory of existing effects (pixelation, outlines, HUD overlays).

**Key Tasks & Metaprompts**
- *Adaptive Render Path Switch*
  - Metaprompt: “Refactor `SandboxRenderer` so the engine auto-selects a no-post, half-resolution, or full chain render path per frame based on current GPU time. Implement a hysteresis-driven budget (target 6 ms) and expose a debug HUD overlay.”
- *WebGPU Experiment Branch*
  - Metaprompt: “Add a flag to bootstrap the Three.js WebGPURenderer. Render terrain, vegetation, and NPC billboards in parity with WebGL, falling back gracefully when the adapter lacks features. Document incompatibilities.”
- *Post-Chain Modularization*
  - Metaprompt: “Decompose post-processing into discrete passes with data-driven config (JSON/TS). Allow toggling SMAA, pixelation, outlines individually and support per-mode defaults.”

**Validation**
- GPU frame time averages ≤6 ms across 60 s capture in Zone Control and Open Frontier (Chrome Profiler trace attached to ticket).
- WebGPU prototype renders feature-parity scenes with <3% deviation in measured luminance compared to WebGL reference screenshots.
- Post-processing toggles persist per mode, verified via automated Playwright smoke test.

**Best-Practice References (2024–2025)**
- Three.js r160–r165 release notes on WebGPURenderer + EffectComposer interop.
- Google Chrome WebGPU samples (`googlechrome/chrome-samples/webgpu`) — dynamic render budget patterns.

## 2. NPC Simulation: ECS & Job Scheduling

**Outcome**: 150+ active agents with deterministic behavior and <4 ms main-thread budget in both game modes.

**Why Now**: Current `CombatantSystem` sorts/maps objects each frame, causing GC churn and uneven frame pacing when agent counts climb.

**Readiness Checklist**
- Profiling captures showing CPU cost by subsystem.
- Agreement on ECS library (bitecs, ecsy, or custom typed-array layer).

**Key Tasks & Metaprompts**
- *ECS Migration Spike*
  - Metaprompt: “Prototype combatant data in a struct-of-arrays using `bitecs`. Mirror current fields (position, velocity, state, squad) and benchmark update step vs. class-based system.”
- *Job Scheduler & Time Slicing*
  - Metaprompt: “Implement a frame-budgeted job scheduler that batches AI/LOS updates. Use priority queues per distance bucket to keep near-field agents at 60 Hz and far-field at 5 Hz.”
- *Memory Pooling & Scratch Buffers*
  - Metaprompt: “Introduce shared scratch `Vector3`/`Matrix4` pools for renderer + AI, eliminating per-frame allocations. Guard with unit tests to catch re-entrancy issues.”

**Validation**
- ECS prototype demonstrates ≥35% reduction in CPU time for `CombatantSystem.update` in profiling capture.
- Scheduler keeps 95th percentile frame time <18 ms while sustaining 150 agents (profiling artifact attached).
- Heap snapshots before/after show garbage collection pause reductions ≥40%.

**Best-Practice References (2024–2025)**
- `LastTry/bitecs` docs & migration guides for typed-array ECS.
- GDC 2024 “Data-Oriented JavaScript” (Olli Leino, Playable Agency).

## 3. Combat AI Optimization & Behavior Layers

**Outcome**: Tactical behaviors maintained while CPU cost scales sub-linearly with combatant count; AI remains responsive across biomes.

**Why Now**: AI currently recomputes squad coordination and LOS with expensive raycasts (`chunkManager.raycastTerrain`) even for culled agents.

**Readiness Checklist**
- Heatmap of LOS checks per frame.
- Identified hotspots from Chrome Trace (Performance tab) or Spector.js.

**Key Tasks & Metaprompts**
- *LOS Acceleration Structure*
  - Metaprompt: “Integrate `three-mesh-bvh`’s accelerated raycast with cached terrain tiles. Batch LOS queries per chunk to amortize BVH traversal.”
- *Influence Map for Strategic Targeting*
  - Metaprompt: “Compute a low-resolution influence grid using worker threads. Feed scores into squad target selection instead of per-agent random zone picks.”
- *Predictive Animation States*
  - Metaprompt: “Pre-cache billboard animation states per squad tick instead of per-agent. Broadcast state changes via event emitter to renderer.”

**Validation**
- LOS cache cuts per-frame raycasts by ≥50% (instrumentation counter reported in HUD).
- Influence map decisions reduce average squad idle time → <3 s (telemetry export screenshot).
- Animation cache eliminates duplicate texture swaps confirmed via renderer logs and visual QA pass.

**Best-Practice References (2024–2025)**
- `gkjohnson/three-mesh-bvh` advanced usage notes (instanced meshes, shared bounds).
- Overwatch 2 AI GDC 2023 talk on influence maps — still relevant for large squads.

## 4. World Streaming & Terrain Pipeline

**Outcome**: Terrain streaming peaks under 2 ms/frame, memory footprint below 1.5 GB, no hitching when sprinting across Open Frontier.

**Why Now**: `ImprovedChunkManager` scans huge instance arrays and uses `setInterval`, risking drift; vegetation allocations never shrink.

**Readiness Checklist**
- Baseline metrics: chunk load time, vegetation instance counts, memory snapshots.
- Asset catalog with per-texture dimensions.

**Key Tasks & Metaprompts**
- *Frame-Budgeted Streaming Loop*
  - Metaprompt: “Replace `setInterval` loaders with `requestIdleCallback` + frame budget. Track debt and surface telemetry in debug overlay.”
- *Vegetation Pool Refactor*
  - Metaprompt: “Rework GPU vegetation to use chunk-local free lists. Ensure unloading chunks restores `activeCount` and purge zero-scale instances.”
- *Texture Residency & Compression*
  - Metaprompt: “Introduce KTX2/Basis compressed textures with mipmap levels. Add tooling to report VRAM usage per asset bundle.”

**Validation**
- Sprint traversal across Open Frontier exhibits no frame spikes >4 ms, verified in profiler timeline.
- Vegetation pool metrics show `activeCount` returning to baseline after unloading edge chunks (logged in HUD overlay).
- VRAM usage reports <1.2 GB with compressed asset pack, validated via Chrome GPU tab.

**Best-Practice References (2024–2025)**
- `pmndrs/drei` + `three-stdlib` examples on KTX2/Basis compression.
- PlayCanvas & Babylon.js streaming terrain writeups (2023–2024).
- `donmccurdy/three-loader-utils` for async asset pipelines.

## 5. Rendering Layer: Vegetation & Billboard Overhaul

**Outcome**: Vegetation draw calls collapse to 3–4 instanced draws with GPU frustum + distance culling; billboards scale gracefully in 4K.

**Why Now**: Current GPU billboard system keeps per-instance logs, lacks frustum culling, and duplicates meshes for outlines/markers.

**Readiness Checklist**
- Documented vegetation density targets per biome.
- GPU profiling confirming draw-call counts.

**Key Tasks & Metaprompts**
- *GPU Frustum & Depth Culling*
  - Metaprompt: “Add compute-friendly culling via hierarchical depth grid (CPU fallback with `frustum.containsPoint`). Drive instance count for each draw each frame.”
- *Merged Outline Shader*
  - Metaprompt: “Implement single instanced material that renders sprite + outline via shader branching. Remove duplicate instanced meshes.”
- *Biome Density Profiles*
  - Metaprompt: “Externalize vegetation spawn tables (JSON). Support per-mode overrides and runtime blending to reduce density near combat hotspots.”

**Validation**
- Draw call count stays ≤10 in both modes (measured via Three.js renderer info overlay).
- Outline shader replacement verified by matching visual golden images within ±2% pixel variance.
- Density profiles load per mode and adjust runtime (QA script records per-biome instance counts).

**Best-Practice References (2024–2025)**
- `pmndrs/lamina` shader layering examples for outlines.
- GPUInstancing techniques from Unreal 5.3 documentation (conceptual guidance).
- “Clustered Culling for Billboards in WebGL2” — SIGGRAPH 2024 Mobile talk.

## 6. Tooling, Diagnostics & Observability

**Outcome**: Dev builds provide actionable telemetry (FPS, CPU/GPU budgets, AI timers) and automated regression checks for frame time.

**Why Now**: Heavy console logging throttles performance; no automated perf baselines.

**Readiness Checklist**
- Decide on HUD style (React overlay vs. HTML templates).
- Consent on logging policy.

**Key Tasks & Metaprompts**
- *Structured Telemetry HUD*
  - Metaprompt: “Create a detachable debug HUD that streams frame timings, draw calls, job scheduler stats. Toggle via F1 and export JSON snapshots.”
- *Logging Policy & Rate Limiting*
  - Metaprompt: “Wrap console logging with categories + rate limiter. Persist high-frequency events to in-memory ring buffer surfaced via HUD.”
- *Perf Regression Harness*
  - Metaprompt: “Add Playwright or Puppeteer script that runs canned replays (Zone Control / Open Frontier) and records frame timing histograms. Fail CI if p95 exceeds budget.”

**Validation**
- HUD overlay displays live metrics with <0.2 ms update overhead (microbenchmark documented).
- Logging bursts no longer exceed 20 logs/sec (rate limiter metric exposed in HUD).
- CI pipeline gate produces and archives histogram PNG/JSON artifacts per PR.

**Best-Practice References (2024–2025)**
- `pmndrs/leva` for quick debug UI panels.
- Chrome Trace Event format (`trace-event-lib`) for custom profiling exports.
- Playwright GPU benchmarking recipes (Microsoft Build 2024 session).

## 7. Asset & Build Pipeline Hardening

**Outcome**: Deterministic builds with hashed asset bundles, automated linting, and per-branch preview deployments.

**Why Now**: Large textures + audio assets live unchecked; no automated sanity checks or CDN-friendly pipeline.

**Readiness Checklist**
- Inventory of current npm scripts & Vite config.
- Storage budget for CI artifacts.

**Key Tasks & Metaprompts**
- *Asset Lint & Budgeting*
  - Metaprompt: “Add a `pnpm run audit:assets` script that flags textures >2048², audio >5 MB, and missing compression. Fail CI on violations.”
- *Deterministic Build Outputs*
  - Metaprompt: “Configure Vite build to emit hashed filenames, asset manifest, and gzip/brotli sizes. Document deployment checklist.”
- *Preview Deploy Pipeline*
  - Metaprompt: “Set up GitHub Actions (or alternative CI) to build, run perf harness, and deploy preview builds to a staging bucket with auto-expiring links.”

**Validation**
- Asset audit fails on introduced over-budget files (sample PR demonstrating guard).
- Build artifacts hash-stable across repeated runs (CI log comparison).
- Preview deployments accessible via signed URL, auto-expire confirmed after retention period.

**Best-Practice References (2024–2025)**
- Vite 5.x docs on `build.rollupOptions.output.manualChunks` & asset hashing.
- GitHub Actions reusable workflows for WebGL builds (`actions/examples` repo, 2024 updates).
- `asset-buddy` / `webpack-bundle-analyzer` analogs for Vite (`rollup-plugin-visualizer`).

## 8. Mode-Specific Balancing & Scalability

**Outcome**: Zone Control and Open Frontier share core tech but toggle density, LOD, and spawn logic via data-driven configs.

**Why Now**: Today’s configs adjust counts but not AI cadence, chunk budgets, or vegetation density; Open Frontier suffers from Zone Control-centric tuning.

**Readiness Checklist**
- Profiling comparisons between modes.
- Agreement on acceptable NPC counts & view distances per mode.

**Key Tasks & Metaprompts**
- *Mode Parameter Matrix*
  - Metaprompt: “Create a declarative `modeProfiles` module that centralizes LOD ranges, render distances, job budgets, vegetation scalars. Wire into system initializers.”
- *Dynamic Ticket & Respawn Scaling*
  - Metaprompt: “Adjust ticket bleed and respawn timers based on current active agents and performance budget. Ensure fairness via automated tests.”
- *Playtest Telemetry Export*
  - Metaprompt: “Record per-mode metrics (average FPS, deaths, zone flips) into CSV/JSON for balancing. Provide export hotkey.”

**Validation**
- Switching modes updates all linked systems without manual code edits (unit/integration tests).
- Telemetry exports consumed by balancing spreadsheet, containing expected fields validated by schema test.
- Automated match simulations finish within target duration ±10% for both modes.

**Best-Practice References (2024–2025)**
- Battlefield franchise postmortems on mode scaling (GDC Vault).
- “Data-Driven Difficulty Tuning” — Game Dev Summit 2024 panel.
- Open-source balancing tooling (`open-balancing-suite`).

## 9. Future-Facing: Multiplayer & Netcode Feasibility (Optional)

**Outcome**: Documented path to coop/multiplayer, even if not immediate, ensuring current architecture doesn’t block future work.

**Why Now**: ECS/job system migration decisions affect replication strategies.

**Readiness Checklist**
- Network latency targets & authoritative model decision.
- Audit of deterministic vs. non-deterministic systems.

**Key Tasks & Metaprompts**
- *Determinism Audit*
  - Metaprompt: “Catalog all random sources and time-based animations. Propose seeding & lockstep-friendly alternatives where needed.”
- *State Snapshot Prototype*
  - Metaprompt: “Prototype binary state snapshots for ECS data. Measure size & diff frequency for 60 Hz replication.”
- *Rollback Feasibility Study*
  - Metaprompt: “Evaluate lightweight rollback architecture inspired by GGPO. Document costs for physics, AI, and terrain streaming.”

**Validation**
- Determinism audit checklist signed off with mitigation plan per random source.
- Snapshot prototype transmits ≤64 KB per frame for 120 agents (profiling output attached).
- Rollback study includes go/no-go recommendation with estimated engineering weeks.

**Best-Practice References (2024–2025)**
- `colyseus/colyseus` ECS synchronization examples (2024 updates).
- GGPO rollback whitepapers & Slippi netcode postmortem.
- Valve’s “Networked Physics in Dota 2 Reborn” (still relevant for determinism planning).
