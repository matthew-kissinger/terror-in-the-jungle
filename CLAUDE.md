## Key Files

- `src/core/PixelArtSandbox.ts` - Main game class (split into 3 modules)
- `src/core/PixelArtSandboxInit.ts` - Async initialization + `startGameWithMode()`
- `src/core/bootstrap.ts` - Entry point (async, awaits initialization)
- `src/ui/loading/LoadingScreen.ts` - Loading screen with mode selection

## Game Modes

| Mode | Map | NPCs | Duration |
|------|-----|------|----------|
| Zone Control | 400x400 | 15v15 | 3 min |
| Open Frontier | 3200x3200 | 60v60 | 15 min |
| Team Deathmatch | 400x400 | 15v15 | 5 min |

## Profiling Tools

- **F2 Overlay**: FPS, draw calls, triangles, chunk stats, combatant counts, memory
- **Console `perf.report()`**: Full telemetry report
- **Console `perf.benchmark(1000)`**: Raycast/hit detection benchmark
- **AI Sandbox mode**: `?sandbox=true&npcs=80&autostart=true` for automated testing

## Controls

- **WASD** Move, **Shift** Sprint, **Space** Jump
- **Click** Fire, **RClick** ADS, **R** Reload
- **1-6** Weapons, **G** Grenade, **Z** Squad UI, **TAB** Scoreboard
- **F1** Console stats, **F2** Performance overlay, **M** Mortar camera
- **Mobile**: Virtual joystick, touch-drag look, fire/ADS/reload/grenade/scoreboard buttons, weapon bar, helicopter entry

## Known Tech Debt

- 15 `: any` annotations in source (excluding tests and SystemInterfaces)
- Players can fire during weapon switch animation (no `isSwitching()` guard in `FirstPersonWeapon.tryFire()`)
- Mortar system has no touch controls - completely inaccessible on mobile (no weapon slot, no touch aiming)
- Minimap `200x200px` is hardcoded - not responsive for mobile viewports
- Desktop keyboard hints shown on mobile: "Press R to reload", "Press K", "RCTRL", "Press TAB" (5+ locations)
- PersonalStatsPanel/KillFeed overlap on mobile right side (fixed pixel positions)
- Scoreboard 2-column grid not responsive for portrait mobile

### Fixed on branches (9 branches pending merge - blocked on merge task)
- ~~WeatherSystem rain scaling by GPU tier~~ (branch scales particles for mobile)
- ~~Compass responsive for mobile~~ (branch has media queries)
- ~~Sandbag rotation + rally point touch buttons~~ (branch has TouchSandbagButtons, TouchRallyPointButton)
- ~~OpenFrontierRespawnMap touch support~~ (branch has pan/zoom/select)
- ~~TicketSystem.restartMatch() wired~~ (branch has graceful restart)
- ~~TouchWeaponBar dispose() leak~~ (branch fixes event listener cleanup)
- ~~SquadRadialMenu touch support~~ (branch has touch events)
- ~~Settings labels device-aware~~ (branch has mobile-friendly labels)
- ~~Kill streak audio~~ (branch has procedural audio stings)
