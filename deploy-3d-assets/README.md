## Integration Guide

### Loading
```javascript

const loader = new GLTFLoader();
loader.load('assets/weapons/m16a1.glb', (gltf) => {
  scene.add(gltf.scene);
});
```

### Conventions
- **Coordinate system:** Y-up, models face +Z, ground plane at Y=0

- **Scale:** Real-world units (meters). Weapons ~0.5-1.5m, vehicles ~3-12m, buildings ~5-10m
- **Naming:** Each GLB root node is named (e.g., "M16A1", "UH1_Huey", "RadioCommsTower")
- **Wheels:** Use `cylinderGeo` oriented with `rotation [0,0,90]` (NOT torusGeo)
